## Howdy 

My name is Amaury, I'm a product-minded software engineer from France.

I'm currently working at Trendsales 💛, a danish secondhand marketplace ♻️, recently acquired by Vinted.

I consider myself technology-agnostic, but I have most experience in languages such as Java, Kotlin, Javascript/Typescript.

Wanna know more about me ? You can visit my [website here](https://mawagusura.github.io)

If I'm not answering, I'm probably rock climbing or sailing in the open seas.

See ya ⛵
